## Ant Colony Based Clustering
Ant Colony based Clustering in MATLAB 
### Description
The MATLAB code ACOmain.m is a simple ACO algorithm implementation with is coded with a sythetic dataset of 4 Gaussian distributions. The code when run, provides a beautiful visualization of the ant colony working on the data. 
### Coding stlye
I only have access to MATLAB 2007. The code may not follow all the best practices and may not be optimal but it is meant to give a head start to anyone who wishes to take it up and improve it.
