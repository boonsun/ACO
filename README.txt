# Program : Ant Colony Based Clustering
# Coding stlye : I only have access to MATLAB 2007. The code may not follow all the best practices and may not be optimal but it is meant to give a heads up to anyone who wishes to take it up and improvise it. 
# Description : The MATLAB code ACOmain.m is a simple ACO algorithm implementation with is coded with a sythetic dataset of 4 Gaussian distributions. The code when run, provides a beautiful visualization of the ant colony working on the data.
